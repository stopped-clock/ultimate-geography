# Ultimate Geography Population Fork

This fork of the Ultimate Geography repo creates a new brainbrew recipe and associated files to create a version of the Ultimate Geography deck that includes cards testing on population.

## Details Regarding Population Numbers

Specifically, these are the U.N. estimates for July 2025, taken from the 2024 [Revision of World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/).

- If you are reading this in 2026 or later, you can find the archived estimates [here](https://population.un.org/wpp/downloads?folder=Archive&group=CSV%20files).
- The estimates collated in 2024 are of course based on data collected in 2023 or, likely, earlier, depending on the census timelines in each country.
- The year 2025 was chosen in order to maximally decrease "staleness" of the numbers memorized.
- I intend to update the 2025 population numbers when the next revision comes out in 2026.

- These are all rounded to 3 signficant digits, to avoid wasting brainpower memorizing longer numbers. 

- Purely from eyeballing graphs, I can say that population in many countries does change to the extent that those 3 digits would be different for the population of 2026 than they are for 2025.
- However, for people who memorize the numbers for 2025, it seems exhausting to continually memorize populations for each country in 2026, 2027, 2028, etc. I can make no promises as to the state of the world or my personal situation in 2030, but that seems like a logical time for people to memorize new population numbers.
